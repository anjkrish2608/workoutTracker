## Description of Application
This application creates a database in which a user can store information on their workouts. The user can create a new excercise and add it to a workout and view statistics created based on their past entries.
Unfortunately I was unable to complete this application to function correctly, at the moment the application can create a database and display the main page.

## Technologies Used
While creating this application I have used many different technologies listed below:
* JavaScript ES6 : to write the code in server.js, html-routes and api-routes
* Node JS : to run the server.js file
* Path Package : to link the output html files
* Express Package : to run the routes and manipulate the data
* Mongoose Package : to create and link to a database on MongoDB

## Challenges Faced
